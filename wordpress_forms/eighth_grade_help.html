  <h1>Eighth Grade Courses</h1>
  <p>Some academically advanced students may have taken high school level courses before beginning high school. For example, a student taking Algebra I in the 8th grade may want to include it on his or her transcript if they don't have four math credits in 9th - 12th grades. In general, only core classes that are truly at a high school level are considered eligible to be included on a transcript. </p>
