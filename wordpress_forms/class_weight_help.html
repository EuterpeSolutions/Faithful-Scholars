  <h1>Class Weight	</h1>
  <p>The SC Uniform Grading Scale calls for high school classes to be classified as College Prep (4.0 scale), Honors (5.0 scale), or AP or Dual Credit (6.0 scale). </p>
  <ul>
    <li>College Prep (CP): This is a standard course of study in high school</li>
    <li>Honors (H): These courses go beyond the basic scope of the college prep courses. They are more rigorous, requiring completion of text as well as extra projects or additional work. </li>
    <li>AP: Advanced Placement classes must be completed through a College Board certified course provider/teacher or college. The AP test may be taken at the end of the course. An AP exam may be taken in any subject, however without participation in an approved AP course it cannot be awarded a GPA bump. </li>
    <li>Dual Credit (DC): This applies to courses taken at a local college or through an online college. Faithful Scholars credits a student with Dual Credit only for core curriculum classes. All non-core classes taken from a college will be weighted as honors level, and non-core, non-academic courses will be weighted as College Prep.</li>
  </ul>
